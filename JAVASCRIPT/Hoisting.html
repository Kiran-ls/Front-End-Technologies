    VAR
    1. The variables which are declared using "var" will be intialized with undefined at the time of memory allocation phase.
    2. When JS code loaded global execution record will be created internally. This will be devided into two parts:
            a> Memory allocation phase. b> Code execution phase. 
    3. At Memory allocation phase memory will be allocated for all declaration parts of code, then only code will be executed.
